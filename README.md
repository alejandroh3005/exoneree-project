# Exoneree Project
### An analysis of race and wrongful conviction within the United States National Registry of Exonerations

The pursuit of justice is a fundamental pillar of the United States legal system, aiming to hold accountability
for the guilty and protection of the innocent. However, the justice system design induces wrongful convictions
through eyewitness misidentification, false or misleading forensic evidence, perjury, official misconduct, and
inadequate legal defense. The consequences of wrongful conviction are serious and often irreversible, resulting
in loss of liberty and damage to the reputation of individuals and their families. Increased scrutiny of criminal
cases and efforts of dedicated legal advocates have facilitated the *exoneration* (reversal of conviction and
clearing of charges) of numerous individuals who were unjustly convicted. Exoneration brings attention to
shortcomings of the criminal justice system and consideration of innocents who are currently imprisoned.
The National Registry of Exonerations is a project from the University of California, Irvine; University of
Michigan; and Michigan State University which gathers detailed information on every exoneration in the
United States since 1989. Their extensive registry includes personal demographics and describes criminal
sentences, time served, and pathway to exoneration. This wealth of information allows researchers, policymakers, 
legal practitioners, and the public to analyze trends, identify systemic issues within the criminal justice system,
and advocate for reforms aimed at preventing future wrongful convictions.

In collaboration with Cindy Elder and Dr. Nayak L Pollisar at the University of Washington, we examine the National 
Registry of Exonerations from the University of Michigan to analyze individuals exonerated in the United States since 
1989 through descriptive statistics and statistical modeling. This document and our work are in progress.

## Race and Crime
#### Conducted the Spring and Summer seasons of 2024

This preceeding work aimed to describe univariate and intersectional profiles of sex, race, age (at conviction), and 
(alleged) crime. We also sought to visualize compare distributions of age at events (alleged crime, conviction, release, 
exoneration) by race.

## Race and Wrongful Conviction
#### To be completed the Autumn season of 2024

This new work aims to study causes of wrongful convictions and explore associations with official misconduct, 
again with considerations of race and profiles we have found in our preliminary work.
